This tutorial covers how to use the Kopernicus feature "baryCenter"

This has nothing to do with SigmaBinary, you can do it without my mod installed

HOW:

If you want to make a barycenter using kopernicus feature it's really simple.

STEP 1

create a custom planet, you just need a template, an orbit and some basic properties:
(make sure this planet loads into ksp before adding the "baryCenter" line):

## CODE ##

@Kopernicus:AFTER[Kopernicus]
{
	Body
	{
		name = mySWAGbarycenter
		Template
		{
			name = Mun  // any other planet will work
		}
		Orbit
		{
			// Choose your orbit, I don't think I need to explain this :)
		}
		Properties
		{
			// Choose the mass you want
		}
		baryCenter = true
	}
}

## END CODE ##

Pretty simple huh?

Using this method you will not be able to select the barycenter in the tracking station or in map view.

This is intended.

Currently the barycenter shows up in the science archives (not intended),
but I think that a future patch of Kopernicus will address that.


Have fun baryCentering!
